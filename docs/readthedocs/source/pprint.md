# Pretty Printing

In Calva, pretty printing is a mode. Prettiness is on by default and all your evaluation results will get that treatment.

## Toggle it

There is a `pprint` indicator to the right in the status bar which shows the status of the mode. Click the indicator to toggle prettification on and off. There is also a **Calva: Toggle Pretty Printing for All Evaluations** command.

Tip: If you have evaluated something time consuming, or that is not idempotent, with pretty printing mistakenly off: _toggle it on and evaluate `*1`._

## Configuration

For most people the defaults will probably work, but Calva pretty printing comes a few knobs you can turn, and they are all available through the `calva.prettyPrintingOptions` settings. Things you can set are:

Setting          | Type    | Effect
-------          | ----    | ------
`enabled`        | boolean | so this is a third way you can change this mode üòÑ
`clientOrServer` | `client` or `server` | defaults to `client`, more on this below
`serverPrinter`  | enum    | when `clientOrServer` is set to `server`, this setting chooses which printer function that will be used, more on this below
`width`          | number  | the maximum line length of printed output (or at least the printers will try)
`maxLength`      | number  |  the maximum number of elements printed in nested nodes, [good for evaluating something like `(iterate inc 0)`](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/*print-length*#example-542692cac026201cdc326b12), which you shouldn't do without setting `maxLength`. Most printers will indicate truncated lists with `...` at the end.
`maxDepth`       | number  | the maximum number of levels deep that will get printed. Different printers mark a stop different ways. `puget` doesn't support it at all.

Here's an example of how the default pretty printer in Calva, `zprint`, handles `maxDepth` (from the [Calva implementation](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/blob/dev/src/cljs-lib/src/calva/pprint/printer.cljs) of it's client side pretty printing.).

```clojure
  (pretty-print [[[[[[[[:deeper]]]]]]]] {:max-depth 4})
  ;; => {:value "[[[[##]]]]"}
```

### Client or Server Prettifiers

Pretty printing can happen on the _server_ (i.e. in the JVM, via nREPL), or on the _client_ (i.e. in node, via VS Code/Calva). Client side is the default, and it uses `zprint`. Server side you can choose from these printers:

* [`pprint`](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.pprint-api.html), that is `clojure.core/pprint`
* [`fipp`](https://github.com/brandonbloom/fipp)
* [`puget`](https://github.com/greglook/puget)
* [`zprint`](https://github.com/kkinnear/zprint)

It is this particular selection because they all have pre-configured print-functions in [`cider-nrepl`](https://docs.cider.mx/cider-nrepl/). However, at the time of this writing the actual dependency on `zprint` is not provided, so you will have to do that yourself. (For the server side, that is. Client side you don't need to do anything.)

### Why does Server or Client Side Matter?

This matters because on the server there is more going on than just pretty printing. Pretty printing results on the server causes the them to be evaluated. WHich can have HUGE implications depending on the results and which printer is used. With `puget` and [Datomic](https://www.datomic.com) transaction results, you will get the whole database printed. Twice. And if there are circular references you will get nothing printed, instead you will soon have a very hot computer.

> Note: With the help of zprint creator, [Kim Kinnear](https://github.com/kkinnear), we have [found ways](https://github.com/kkinnear/zprint/issues/111) to compensate for this problems. Ways that we will implement server side (in `cider-nrepl`) as well, stay tuned.

Then, why not always do it client side? It turns out that on the client side there are also things going on. Calva gets the results back as a string and therefore it needs to first be parsed back to [EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn), before it can be pretty printed by `zprint`. And ‚Äì here's the catch ‚Äì all results are not valid EDN and therefore can't be pretty printed by `zprint`. Datomic transaction results are one example.

### Need More Configurability?

The current options are limited, because our time developing Calva is limited. But `cider-nrepl` really allows for fully configurable pretty printing, so it is within reach. Please feel invited to give us feedback on what you would want to configure for the printing of results. File issues and/or chat us up in #calva-dev on the Clojurians slack.

Enjoy Prettiful Printing! ‚ù§Ô∏è
