# Using Calva with WSL

The use of Calva with WSL is now fully supported through the [Remote - WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) extension. Simply install the extension an open your project with one of the `Remote-WSL` commands. Calva will run directly in the WSL environment and no further configuration is required.
