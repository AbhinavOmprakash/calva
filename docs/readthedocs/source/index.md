[Calva](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva) is an integrated REPL powered environment for enjoyable and productive [Clojure] (https://clojure.org) and [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). It includes inline code evaluation, Paredit, code formatting, a test runner, syntax highlighting, [linting](linting.md), and more. [Calva is open source](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva), and free to use.

## Getting Started

First thing you need to do is to get [Calva connected to the REPL of your project](connect.md). Then we suggest you check out [Something to Try First](try-first.md).

The below list of contents is sorted in what we think is a good **Getting Started** order.

One thing to note about Calva's code formatter is that it sets the default keybinding of the **Format Current Form** command to `tab`. Good to know, right?


## How to Contribute to Calva?

I'm glad you asked! Please see the [Calva Development Wiki](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/wiki). (There, in a section labeled **The Tao of Calva**, we also try to make clear *why* you would want to contribute.)
