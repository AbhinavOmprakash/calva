# Get Started with Clojure

Welcome to a zero-install, interactive, guide to get you started with [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) using:

* [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) (A development environment delivered via the web browser)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (Part of Gitpod. In your web browser. Zero-install, remember?)
* Calva (surprise!)
  * Calva's [Getting Started REPL](getting-started.md)

??? Note "I have VS Code and Java"
    Awesome. Install Calva and fire up the [Getting Started REPL](getting-started.md). By all means read this page and anyway, you can just skip the Gitpod parts.

    Also: _If you are using Windows_ your Java might have [a bug](https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8266473) that [prevents things from working](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/issues/1162). Then you might want to defer fixing that and use the zero-install option first.

??? Note "Is it exactly as VS Code?"
    Almost! But, yeah, there are _some_ difference between regular VS Code and Gitpod's ditto. Most of it doesn't matter, but finding the main menu can be a bit tricky:
    ![Here is the menu in Gitpod VS Code](images/getting-started-with-clojure/gitpod-vscode-menu.png)

## What you'll learn

* The basics of the Clojure language (at least the start of the basics)
* The basics of the [ClojureScipt](https://clojurescript.org) language (we won't be using ClojureScript, but it is same language üòÄ)
* The basics of Calva (It's a bit as a side effect. You need it to learn Clojure this way, and by learning Clojure this way, Calva knowledge trickles in.)
* What is meant by, and some ways to perform, *Interactive Programming* (aka REPL Driven Development)
* Where to find Clojurians (and thus help, the friendliest help you have ever seen a community provide)

## What you won't learn

* How to install Clojure for your operating system of choice
* About various old and new build and dependency tools
* How to create projects and do real stuff

??? Note "Why won't I learn about this?"
    All in due time. üòÑ It can be a bit confusing with all the things you find out about installing Clojure and creating projects when searching for information about it. We want you to relax about all that and just enjoy learning a bit about this fantastic programming language and the wonderful mode of development it offers.

    There is a lot of info about this out there already. And since you will learn where to find Clojurians, you will also find guidance. But we suggest do these things later. First, let's focus on having fun with Interactive Programming!

## What you need

* Curiosity about Clojure
* A web browser

??? Note "I am new to VS Code"
    You might want to have a look at [this Getting Started with VS Code video](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics). (You can of course ignore the parts about installing for now.) Also, have [this overview of the VS Code interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) handy.
    

## How it works

1. You will open an instance of VS Code in a development environment running in the browser. The envirnoment will have Java, Clojure tools, and Calva installed.
    * ???+ Note "Gitpod Sign-in"
           You will be asked to sign in to Gitpod, if you aren't already. You can do so with your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket accounts, so no hassles at all.
2. Instructions will be automatically displayed (very brief such, because it is mainly about firing up the [Getting Started REPL](getting-started.md))
3. The guides are a mix of prose (in Clojure line comments), Clojure code, and exercises. What's extra poetic is that you will use Calva and Clojure to learn Calva and Clojure.

Use a desktop/laptop computer. Even if it actually works on the phone, it is far from convenient.

It sometimes takes a while (several minutes) for the environment to initialize. Take some deep breaths and be patient. üòé

???+ Note "Stuck? Something not working? Or just unclear?"
     Please don't hesitate to reach out for help, should you get stuck. See below for where to find Clojurians. As for the Calva team, we are almost always (true story) to be found at the Clojurians Slack, especially in the `#calva` Channel. We are `@pez` and `@bringe` there.

Happy Interactive Programming! ‚ù§Ô∏è

## And where do I find those Clojurians?

We Clojurians inhabit a lot of community platforms. I'll list some of the more popular ones here in some order of popularity.

* [The Clojurians Slack](http://clojurians.net) - by far the largest and mst active Clojure community, the `#beginners` channel is spectacularly fantastic
* [ClojureVerse](https://clojureverse.org) - a web forum. Lots of Clojurians, lots of Clojure knowledge collected, easy to search, easy to join
* [/r/Clojure](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/) - Reddit when Reddit is at its best, lots of Clojurians here
* On Discord there are two active servers: [Clojurians](https://discordapp.com/invite/v9QMy9D) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/)

You can also ask questions, and find answers, about Clojure at [ask.clojure.org](https://ask.clojure.org)
