# Why Calva?

**Over 48,000 VS Code users trust Calva to make Clojure development fast and fun.**

## Calva gets out of your way

Write Clojure without worrying about your tools.

- **Calva gets you moving quickly**. No code, configs or keybindings to add. No run configurations to create and maintain. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Calva](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva) then [get started](getting-started.md).
- **Calva ships with everything you need**. Calva gives you syntax highlighting, language server integration (go to definition, find references, refactoring), REPL integration, linting, formatting, structural editing and more.
- **Calva has great defaults**. Good keybindings and smart choices by experienced Clojure users take the pain out of getting started and finding your flow.
- **Calva's features are discoverable**. See what Calva can do: open VS Code's Command Palette with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd> on Windows/Linux or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd> on macOS, then type “calva” to see a list of commands.

## Calva is with you for the journey

Beginner? Professional Clojure developer? Calva was made for you.

- **People new to programming** use Calva to focus on learning Clojure in a friendly and intuitive environment.
- **Developers already using VS Code** install Calva to add Clojure support to their favourite editor in seconds.
- **Programmers using other IDEs and editors** sometimes switch to VS Code to write Clojure with Calva. [See the reviews](#calva-is-well-loved).
- **Experienced Clojurists** use Calva because professionals value low-maintenance tools that give them everything they need to use Clojure for work and play.
- **Clojure organisations** support Calva to improve life for existing Clojure users and to lower barriers for new ones. Calva receives financial support from GitHub sponsors who back [Peter](https://github.com/sponsors/PEZ) and [Brandon](https://github.com/sponsors/bpringe), from [Cognitect and Nubank's sponsorship fund](https://www.cognitect.com/blog/2020/12/15/sponsoring-open-source-developers) and from the [Clojurists Together Foundation](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/projects/).

## Calva is free and open

- **Calva and VS Code are free**. There are no licence fees and no annual subscriptions for personal or commercial use. Anyone can inspect, improve and learn from the open source [Calva codebase](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva).
- **Calva is actively developed and supported** by contributors who care about the Clojure experience for VS Code users and about nurturing the wider Clojure community.
- **Calva is built on the shoulders of giants.** Calva uses popular open source community projects such as [clj-kondo](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo), [clojure-lsp](https://github.com/clojure-lsp/clojure-lsp), [cljfmt](https://github.com/weavejester/cljfmt) and [nrepl](https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl) for linting, language server, formatting and REPL features. Calva packages and configures these so you can focus on Clojure instead of gluing tools together.
- **Calva's documentation is open** for all to improve. Click the pencil icon near the page title on any of Calva's documentation pages to submit a correction or improvement.
- **Calva has a positive philosophy**. It wants to be the best “interface between Clojure and human beings”. Its developers put thought into [what Calva should and should not be](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/wiki) so that it can evolve with clear goals in mind.

> 
> Calva offers great defaults with an experience that's easy to get started with for beginners but powerful enough for pros writing Clojure for a living.
>
> Calva bundles open source tools (linters, formatters, language servers) and configures them so they just work.
>
> Calva is also configurable itself, but most users will find they can just install it, jack-in and start hacking on Clojure without another thought.

> That is the biggest thing I can say for Calva, it just works. I was never a fan of VS Code before, but VS Code + Calva for Clojure is now my favourite language / IDE experience.
>
> Plus, the #calva on the clojurians slack is brilliant, always someone there to help if you have issues (although any issue I've had has been squarely on me, and never Calva itself).
>
> I often feel we live in an age where so much software is badly written, without care, slow, buggy and just generally awful. Calva is the complete opposite. I think the maintainers want to, and have, made a wonderful piece of software for Clojure developers.

## Why VS Code?

Calva is an extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a free, popular, simple, extensible and performant code editor for Windows, Mac and Linux.

VS Code comes with strong defaults that are rare to find in combination in [other editors](https://clojure.org/community/tools):

- **Powerful built-in IDE-style features,** notably:
    - An integrated file explorer.
    - A fast file switcher with fuzzy search.
    - A command palette for easy command and keyboard shortcut discoverability.
    - A fast integrated terminal with multi-shell, multi-pane, and multi-split support.
    - Editor tabs, panes, and workspace/project handling.
    - Fast file search [backed by ripgrep](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_11#_text-search-improvements).
    - A project-wide find-and-replace UI.
    - Support for language servers to provide code intelligence features.
    - Support for version control (git out of the box, with [other VCS options](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol) as extensions). 

- **Quality of life perks,** including:
    - A built-in searchable [extension marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) with one-click installs, automatic updates, download counts and user ratings and reviews.
    - A large [theme selection](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=vscode&category=Themes&sortBy=Installs) to customize your editor's appearance and make it your own.
    - [Syncable settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) to back up and reproduce your coding environment on other machines.
    - A choice of configuration via JSON files, a searchable settings UI or a mix of both.
    - A good [accessibility story](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/accessibility#_screen-readers).
    - [Thorough documention](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) including a [short video series introducing VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos).
    - A built-in process explorer to [inspect and profile extension performance](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Performance-Issues).

- **A healthy and growing ecosystem,** featuring:
    - The financial backing of Microsoft.
    - Highly active development with a regular [release cycle](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates).
    - An actively triaged [public issue tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues) managed by the dedicated VS Code team.
    - A large community.
    - An [extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api) including a helpful [extension generator](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension) to bootstrap your first VS Code extension using JavaScript or TypeScript.

## Is VS Code + Calva right for you?

### If you're new to Clojure or new to programming

- **Try VS Code + Calva today and start writing Clojure.**
- **Focus your time on learning Clojure.** You can write Clojure with any editor, but VS Code + Calva is an excellent combination. Stick with them for a while and have fun with Clojure. You can always change your editor later if you want to.

### If you're an experienced developer who uses VS Code, or you don't have a strong editor or IDE preference

- **VS Code + Calva are the perfect fit!** You don't need to spend any more time thinking about it.

### If you're an experienced developer but you don't use VS Code

You might like to explore Clojure support in your favourite editor or IDE first.

- **[Check your editor's Clojure integration options](https://clojure.org/community/tools).**
- **Try Clojure in your editor for a while.**
- **Try VS Code + Calva** later to see how it compares, or if you find the initial setup process with your editor frustrating and just want to focus on Clojure instead of tools. Some developers switch to Calva because they'd rather have strong Clojure support with the essentials configured out of the box over a familiar editor. VS Code is also familiar enough to pick up quickly and extensible enough to change if you don't like its defaults.

### If you're an experienced Clojurist

Thank you for exploring Calva! We think it's worth your time even as a Clojure professional.

- **Calva bundles helpful tools** you might be used to configuring and maintaining manually or not using at all (see [linting](linting.md), [formatting](formatting.md) and [clojure-lsp](clojure-lsp.md)).
- **Calva generally requires no setup, upkeep or adjustments** to write Clojure the way you know and love. It should feel familiar and productive to experienced Clojurists out of the box, especially if you already use [Paredit](paredit.md), which Calva implements and activates by default.
- **Calva is flexible** enough to [customize](customizing.md) if you need to.
- **VS Code + Calva is a great entry point for Clojure students.** If you plan to teach Clojure or build a Clojure team, learning how to use the editor your students and colleagues are using makes helping them easier.
- **VS Code is increasingly hackable and extensible**. See this [Clojureverse forum post](https://clojureverse.org/t/gnu-emacs-cider-vs-vs-code-calva/7829/26?u=nick) from a Calva user who switched from Emacs, for example. They were able to find VS Code equivalents for the features they missed from Emacs, including *which-key* and *Magit*. You can [disable VS Code's telemetry](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting) if reporting usage to Microsoft is unpalatable.
