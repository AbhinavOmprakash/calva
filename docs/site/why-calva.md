# Why Calva?

**Over 48,000 VS Code users trust Calva to make Clojure development fast and fun.** Here's what some of them say:

> My advice to anyone starting their Clojure journey who is unsure about what editor to use:
>
> - Pick something today and start writing Clojure.
> - Probably pick an editor you are familiar with already.
> - **If you’re not familiar with any editor yet or you don’t have a strong allegiance to one, choose VS Code and Calva.**
> - Switch to something else only if you encounter persistent annoyances that you can’t remove with plugins, code/config changes, help from the community, or more sleep.
>
> **I now use VS Code with Calva every day** but went through a long journey trying almost every other editor and plugin combo first. I switched from Emacs to VS Code, which might make my perspective different to others here.
>
> …
>
> I started with the jaded assumption that VS Code was probably bad because it's built by committee at Microsoft on a web-tech based Electron stack, only to find that it succeeds in embodying the spirit of a “hacker's editor” more than even Emacs does in many ways:

> …
>
> **On the benefits of Calva:**
> 
> - **Of all the amazing Clojure community projects, Calva seems most likely to encourage new users to try Clojure and ClojureScript**. A lot of developers use VS Code. It’s been tricky to convince frontend developer friends to try ClojureScript, but at least they don’t have the excuse that they’ll need to switch editors to even try it now. I think as a community we should try to support the projects that encourage Clojure’s adoption and ease of use, including by using those products ourselves.
> 
> - **Calva provides a better first-time experience than any other editor/plugin combo whether you’re new to Clojure or not.** You can install the plugin and be chatting with your REPL in under a minute without any knowledge of Elisp or VimScript/Lua or how to configure Run Configurations in IntelliJ.
> - **The default key bindings are good and the commands are easily discoverable.**
> - **For its age it’s surprisingly feature rich.**

> ★️️️️️★️️️️️★️️️️️★️️️️️★️️️️️ **I switched from Emacs to VS Code on the strength of Calva and have no regrets.**
> 
> Calva offers great defaults with an experience that's easy to get started with for beginners but powerful enough for pros writing Clojure for a living.
>
> Calva bundles open source tools (linters, formatters, language servers) and configures them so they just work.
>
> Calva is also configurable itself, but most users will find they can just install it, jack-in and start hacking on Clojure without another thought.

> ★️️️️️★️️️️️★️️️️️★️️️️️★️️️️️ **I switched from IntelliJ / Cursive to VS Code and Calva and it's been amazing.**
> 
> ...
>
> That is the biggest thing I can say for Calva, it just works. I was never a fan of VS Code before, but VS Code + Calva for Clojure is now my favourite language / IDE experience.
>
> Plus, the #calva on the clojurians slack is brilliant, always someone there to help if you have issues (although any issue I've had has been squarely on me, and never Calva itself).
>
> I often feel we live in an age where so much software is badly written, without care, slow, buggy and just generally awful. Calva is the complete opposite. I think the maintainers want to, and have, made a wonderful piece of software for Clojure developers.

> ★️️️️️★️️️️️★️️️️️★️️️️️★️️️️️ **This is great, and makes VS Code a truly viable IDE/editor for clojure development.**
>
> It already has great REPL support (including inline evaluation), an extensive Paredit implementation, and excellent linting (care of the bundled clj-kondo). Calva is being improved on at an impressive clip by maintainers who appear solidly committed to its ongoing development. It's well-documented, and manages to be both approachable and capable.
>
> A no brainer if you're already a VS Code user, and well worth a look if you're not.

>
> I joined the Slack channel about 2 wks ago and I must say that I'm very impressed by how active and responsive this community is. Already 2 of my issues fixed and I really like Calva (and the extensions it uses!).
>
> These are professional people and they make me very happy!
