# Calva Merch

I (PEZ) was asked where you can buy the Calva T-shirt I am wearing in this video:

You couldn't, then. But now you can! On Amazon.

## The designs

These are the two designs you will find, in some different colors:

### Symbol + Logo

!!! Note
    What's available on this or that Amazon site will vary a bit and it is a bit slow to add a particular design to a particular market. Eventually I hope to have both designs up on these markets: `.com`, `.co.uk`, `.de`, `.fr`, `.it`, `.es`, and `.co.jp`
