# Calva Merch

In this video, I (PEZ) was asked where you can buy the Calva T-shirt I am wearing:

You couldn't, then. But now you can! On Amazon.

## Zero profit

To keep the admin of this shop to a minimum the merch is sold at production prize. There is no royalty going to anyone in the Calva team when you buy one of these t-shirts. You will represent, which is certainly a way to support the project. You are of course encouraged to support us via sponsoring as well:

!!! Note
    What's available on this or that Amazon site will vary a bit and it is a bit slow to add a particular design to a particular market. Eventually I hope to have both designs up on these markets: `.com`, `.co.uk`, `.de`, `.fr`, `.it`, `.es`, and `.co.jp`
